I'am a growth analyst at MercadoLibre. With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. 
i've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. 
So, I want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.
